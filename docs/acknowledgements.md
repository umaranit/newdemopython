# Acknowledgements
This project was developed by Ryan Dens, Ziyang Wang, Alice Duan, and Vinai Rachakonda 
as part of the summer internship program at [Contrast Security](https://www.contrastsecurity.com)

The project is based in large part on the [RailsGoat](https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat) and we 
would like to thank the developers of that project, as well as the developers of all the OWASP "goat" 
projects, for all their hard work.

## Special Thanks
We would especially like to thank Galen Palmer and Justin Leo for overseeing us throughout
the project.
